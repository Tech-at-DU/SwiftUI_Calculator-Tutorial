## What is Xcode?

**Xcode** is Apple’s integrated development environment (IDE) and tool suite for building, testing, and distributing apps on every Apple platform—iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS. It combines a powerful code editor, compiler, debugger, Interface Builder, unit-test runner, and simulator into a single application.

If you plan to develop software for Apple devices, learning Xcode is essential.  
Download and install it before proceeding.
